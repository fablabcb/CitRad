# CitRad - Citizen Science Traffic Radar 

Here you find all the sources about how to build our traffic counter radar system. Find more about the project in general on our [project page](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/ueber-das-cityradar-projekt/453). Discussions about the prototype development you find [here](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/cityradar-teensy-prototyp/492/9). Also we have a separate discussion page about the [development of the casing](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/gehaeusebau-fuer-die-radarsensorelektronik/507).

More details are in the [Software README]() and the [Hardware README](https://github.com/fablabcb/CityRadar/tree/main/Hardware#readme).

In the beginning we started to develop a low noise amplifier for the radar module that we didn't need in the end. You find all about this in the [low-noise-amplifier branch](https://github.com/fablabcb/CityRadar/tree/low-noise-amplifier) and on the [discussion page in our forum](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/citrad-elektronik-entwicklung/454)
